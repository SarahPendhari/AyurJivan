In the middle of the day, when the sun is at its peak height, so too is our internal digestive fire (agni) at its strongest. Therefore this is the ideal time to eat the largest and most nourishing meal of the day.    ",

Eat early, with plenty of time (at least 2 hours) to digest before going to bed. A smaller quantity of the lunch menu would suffice for dinner. Alternatively you could choose a thick creamy soup with hearty bread and butter, kitchari, or a baked potato with sauteed veggies."

The overnight fast is very beneficial to kapha, however if the appetite hasn’t returned in the morning, there is no use eating just for the sake of it. Start with some herbal tea (perhaps ginger tea to stimulate agni) and a plate of fresh or stewed fruits.",
    lunch:"lunch: During the middle of the day the digestive fire (agni) is as its strongest. Therefore, Ayurveda teaches that lunch should be the largest and most nourishing meal of the day. Kapha thrives on a wide range of cooked (steamed or sauteed) vegetables with appropriate grains and legumes, freshly prepared with plenty of digestive spices.",
    dinner:"Dinner: The evening meal should be significantly lighter and smaller than lunch. However, it is still best to favour a warm and nourishing meal. Soups and stews cooked with plenty of digestive spices and served in smaller portions are ideal for soothing kapha without over-taxing the digestive system. "},
